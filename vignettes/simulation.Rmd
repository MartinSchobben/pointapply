The R package `pointapply` contains the code and data to reconstruct the publication: Martin Schobben, Michiel Kienhuis, and Lubos Polerecky. 2021. *New methods to detect isotopic heterogeneity with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry*, preprint on [Eartharxiv](https://eartharxiv.org/).


# Introduction 

This vignette shows how ion count data of a Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) isotope analysis is simulated, which forms the basis to test the intra- and inter isotope test as introduced in the paper (Section 4.1 *Simulated data*). The accompanying vignette *Visualise test performance* (`vignette("performance")`) provide the code to plot these results (Figs 4 and 5).

The following packages are used for the simulation.


```{r setup, eval=TRUE}
library(point) # regression diagnostics
library(pointapply) # load package
```


```{r bld, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
on_build <- FALSE
```  


The performance of the intra- and inter-isotope tests, bundled in this package, are tested with the simulated (or synthetic) data.


# Simulate intra-isotope variability data

The first simulation is designed to assess the sensitivity of the intra-isotope variability test for two continuous variables; 1) ionization efficiency and, 2) the isotope offset between two components. The ionization efficiency is a systematic fluctuation in the emitted secondary ions, that should normally be mirrored in strength among both isotopes of the same element [@Fitzsimons2000a]. The ionization effect will have a bearing on the intra-isotope variability test, as it is a regression-based method, where variance of the independent variable yields more precise estimation of the coefficients in the linear model. See the figure below to see how the difference in ionization efficiency affects how data point cluster, where a dense cluster signifies the absence of variability in in ionization effeciency and an elongated cluster with increased variance of ionization.


```{r estimates}

```
In the above representation, the label "predicted" and "true" refer to a band of two times the predicted and descriptive standard deviation of $X^a$ around the mean, respectively. The difference in those two error bars during fluctuating ionization is referred to in the paper as "excess ionization".

The isotope offset encompasses two end-member components that cause intra-isotope variability in the analysis, and this is one of the foremost targets in this study. Hence, a range of 22.0‰ is chosen to mimic the divergent isotope composition of carbonate and organic carbon inclusion hosted in a predominant carbonate matrix as a realistic scenario for a SIMS isotope analyses. Whereas, the range in ionization efficiency is varied from 0 to 120%, or 0 to 34% excess ionization. To exemplify this, the following figure shows a scenario of an organic component with a $\delta$^13^C of 32.0‰ in a predominant carbonate matrix with a $\delta$^13^C of 0‰.


```{r label, options}
purrr::map2_dfr(
  c(4, 10),
  c(-32, 0), 
  ~point::simu_R(60, "asymmetric", "13C", "12C", "VPDB", .seed = .x, .devR = .y)
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    force.nm = dplyr::if_else(force.nm == -32, "heterogeneity", "ideal")
    ) %>% 
  diag_R("13C", "12C", force.nm, .plot = TRUE, .N = N.sm, .X = Xt.sm, 
         .plot_outlier_labs = c("organic", "carbonate"))

# save and print
save_point("hetero_concept", p, width = 15, height = 10,

```


```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Conceptual sketches for isotopic offset.", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/hetero_concept.png")   
```


## Parameters

These parameters are then crossed for all possible combination with the `tidyr` [@tidyr] function `crossing()`. In addition, a 10 times repetition is included with a specified seed for each of the repetitions to ensure that the study is reproducible. 


```{r paramsintra}
# repetition
reps <- 10
# types of R variation
var_R <- c("symmetric", "asymmetric")
# varying linear trends in the ionization efficiency (percent common isotope)
var_T <- seq(0, 120, length.out = 12)
# varying isotope offset (delta per mille)
var_I <- seq(0, -22, length.out = 12)
# seeds for number generation
n_tot <- prod(sapply(list(var_T, var_R, var_I), length))
var_seed <- 1:n_tot
# cross all possible parameter combinations
ls_parms <- tidyr::crossing(.sys = var_T, .type = var_R, .devR = var_I) %>%
  tibble::add_column(.seed = var_seed) %>%
  summarise(across(.fns = list)) %>% 
  purrr::flatten()
```


## Conceptual models of intra-isotope variability

Besides the isotope-offset introduced above, two scenarios (object `var_R` of the code chunk above) of intra-isotope variability are tested (Supplementary Section 1.2: *Synthetic data* of the paper). The first scenario, referred to as *"asymmetric"* intra-isotope variation, would approximate, for example, a situation in which the primary ion beams cuts through an organic inclusion (component A) with depth within a predominant carbonate matrix (component B), and thus both the matrix and isotopic composition deviate between components A and B. In a second scenario of *"symmetric"* intra-isotope variation, a simulated gradient in the isotopic composition traverses the complete analyses.


```{r concept, echo=FALSE}

Xt2 <- c(1.1e5, 1.3e5) # common
# start (ideal) R

## Execute intra-isotope variability simulation

The function `simu_R()` of the `point` [@point] package is especially designed to simulate SIMS isotope count data. Here, the arguments `.ion1`, `ion2` and `.reference` define the isotope system and reference scale used to simulate the data. Together with the previous defined ranges for the sensitivity test (object `ls_parms`) this produces the simulated dataset with intra-isotope variability.


```{r execintra}
simu_sens_IC_intra <- purrr::pmap_dfr(ls_parms, point::simu_R, .reps = reps, 
                                      .ion1 = "13C", .ion2 = "12C", 
                                      .reference = "VPDB")
```


## Save data 

The function `write_point()` is included in this package and saves the generated data in the appropriate directory (`data` directory of the package).


```{r saveintra, options}
write_point("simu_sens_IC_intra", on_build)
```


# Sensitivity intra-isotope variability test

The functions `diag_R()` of the `point` package are the core functions for assessing intra-isotope variability (as introduced in the paper). To gauge the performance of this test, the `simu_sens_IC_intra` is analysed by subsequently applying the `diag_R()`, to first detect potential outliers and then assess their significance in terms on their effect on the "ideal" linear R model (see paper). 


## Define groups

Both functions require grouping variable in order to define what constitutes a single analysis which, in turn, consists off the $n$-series of measurements, where the outlier are detected in the measurements (and thus gauge intra-isotope variability).


```{r groups}
# groups
grps <- rlang::quos(type.nm, trend.nm, force.nm, spot.nm)
```


## Execute intra-isotope variability test 
 
Two types of outlier detection are available; $\sigma_R$-rejection method (default method in the Cameca software) and the Cook's Distance measure (see paper for details).


### Cooks D

The Cook's D method is the default method of `diag_R()`, and is therefore simple to execute. The argument `.output` is set to `"complete"` so that the generated data frame (`tibble`) contains also metrics for the precision of the isotope and single ion counts.


```{r CD}
# diagnostics
simu_CD_eval_intra <- point::diag_R(simu_sens_IC_intra, "13C", "12C", !!!grps)
# export
write_point("simu_CD_eval_intra", on_build)
```


### Cameca

The $\sigma_R$-rejection method requires the `.method` to be set to `"Cameca"`. In addition, to faithfully mimic the behaviour of the Cameca software the grouping structure needs to be adjusted slightly, where this software uses an intermediate (but artificial) subdivision of a single analysis; the so-called "block" (variable: `bl.nm`), which consists generally of ~50 measurements. To accommodate this, the `diag_R()` and `eval_diag()` functions are successively applied with a respective grouping structure for "blocks" and then "single analysis". Note, that the `.output` of `diag_R()` is set to `"diagnostic"` to only produce outlier detection results. The application of `eval_diag()` produces now mean values for the single blocks, which are irrelevant for the subsequent study, as such the `tibble` [@tibble] is filtered for distinct analysis only by using `dplyr::distinct()` [@dplyr].


```{r CM}
# diagnostics
tb_dia <- point::diag_R(simu_sens_IC_intra , "13C", "12C", !!!grps, bl.nm, 
                        .method = "Cameca", .output = "diagnostic", .N = N.sm, 
                        .Xt = Xt.sm)
# evaluation of performance (intra-isotope test)
CM_eval <- point::eval_diag(tb_dia, "13C", "12C", !!!grps, .N = N.sm, 
                            .Xt = Xt.sm)
# extract distinct groups omitting block-wise means
simu_CM_eval_intra <- dplyr::distinct(CM_eval, !!!grps, .keep_all = TRUE)
# export
write_point("simu_CM_eval_intra", on_build)
```


# Simulate inter-isotope variability data

The simulated data to assess the performance of the inter-isotope variability test encompasses the same rang as for the intra-isotope variability test. However, for this simulation, no intra-isotope variance is included (i.e., the ideal linear R model), and only the starting value is varied over a range of 12.0‰ with again the VPDB isotope scale as a reference framework.


## parameters

The same procedure, but with a somewhat different parameter-set, is used to cross all possible combination with again 10 repetitions.


```{r paramsinter}
# repetition
reps <- 10
# varying linear trends in the ionization efficiency (percent common isotope)
var_T <- seq(0, 120, length.out = 12)
# varying isotope base (delta per mille)
var_B <- seq(0, -11, length.out = 12)
# seeds for number generation
n_tot <- prod(sapply(list(var_T, var_B), length))
var_seed <- 1:n_tot
# cross all possible parameter combinations
ls_parms <- tidyr::crossing(.sys = var_T, .baseR = var_B) %>%
  tibble::add_column(.seed = var_seed) %>%
  summarise(across(.fns = list)) %>% 
  purrr::flatten()
```


## Execute inter-isotope simulation

Execution of the simulation (`simu_R()`) for inter-isotope data follows the same procedure as previously outlined for the intra-isotope data simulation. The largest difference is that the parameter `.type` is now fixed to `"ideal`, referring to the ideal linear R model (i.e. the absence of intra-isotope variability).


```{r execinter}
# execute
simu_sens_IC_inter <- purrr::pmap_dfr(ls_parms,  point::simu_R, .type = "ideal", 
                                      .reps = reps, .ion1 = "13C",
                                      .ion2 = "12C", .reference = "VPDB")
```


## Post-simulation processing

The protocol for simulating the inter-isotope dataset differs from the intra-isotope variability protocol in that it includes a post-simulation processing step. Here, the $m$-series of analyses (a typical study along a transect) is recombined by randomly replacing one out of the 10 samples of the 0‰ (VPDB) set with an analysis that has an isotope value along the predefined range of -12--0‰. This replacement is repeated for each of the initial isotope values as defined in the starting parameters, and repeated 10 times, which produces 10 times 10-series of analyses with one anomalous isotope value, for each of the starting isotope values.

Two wrapper functions perform this randomization in one call with `purrr::map()` [@purrr], and, furthermore, directly write the results to the correct directory.


```{r mixing}
# isotope anomaly mixer
mix_R <- function(simu, filter_vec, seed, reps) {
  set.seed(seed)
  spot_samp <- sample.int(reps, size = 1)
  base <- filter(simu, base.nm == 0, spot.nm != spot_samp)
  anomaly <- filter(simu, base.nm == filter_vec, spot.nm == spot_samp)
  bind_rows(base, anomaly) %>%
    mutate(anomaly.nm = filter_vec, .before = base.nm)
 }

# mixer wrapper
inter_run <- function(vct, n, file_name, reps) {
  simu <- map_dfr(vct, mix_R, simu = simu_sens_IC_inter, seed = n, reps = reps, 
                  .id = "study.nm")
  name <- paste(file_name, n, sep = "_")
  assign(name, simu)
  name %T>% 
    rlang::exec("write_point", ., on_build) %>% 
    rlang::sym() %>% 
    eval()
}

# rerun introduction of anomalous R and save to file
ls_inter <- map(1:10, inter_run, vct = var_B, file_name = "simu_sens_IC_inter", 
                reps = reps)
```


# Sensitivity intra-isotope variability test

The intra-isotope variability test is also encapsulated in the sequential usage of `diag_R()` of the `point` package. 


## Define groups

However, for this sensitivity run the grouping is a little different as it has to point to the $m$-series of analyses, instead of single measurements (in the $n$-series of measurements.


```{r groups2}
# groups
grps <- quos(type.nm, trend.nm, anomaly.nm, study.nm, spot.nm)
```


## Execute inter-isotope variability test 

Also, the execution over the has been packed in a wrapper function that can be applied in successive order by using `purrr::walk2()` [@purrr]. One note of caution, running this code requires a high workload from your computer.


```{r loadinter, echo=FALSE}
# load data
# load_point("simu", paste0("sens_IC_inter_", 1:10), NULL, return_name = FALSE, on_build)
```


```{r inter}
# diagnose, evaluate and write
inter_wrap <- function(simu, n, grps, file_name){
  tb_dia <- diag_R(simu, "13C", "12C", !!!grps)
  name <- paste(file_name, n, sep = "_")
  assign(name, tb_dia)
  exec("write_point", name, on_build)
}

# execute
purrr::walk2(
  ls_inter, 
  seq_along(ls_inter), 
  inter_wrap, 
  grps = grps, 
  file_name = "simu_eval_inter"
  )
```
